# A2AGENCY
The problem addressed by A2AGENCY is the lack of an efficient and user-friendly system for 
managing travel reservations, bookings, and payments. Many travel agencies and companies still rely on manual processes that are timeconsuming, error-prone, and not scalable. This often leads to delays, misunderstandings, and dissatisfaction among customers.
It also aims to solve this problem by providing a digital platform that streamlines the entire travel 
management process, from initial trip planning to final payment. The system should allow customers to browse and compare travel options, 
book tickets, and make payments securely and conveniently. The system should be easy to use, flexible, and customizable to fit the 
specific needs of different travel businesses.
The goal of the Travel Management System project is to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and customer satisfaction of travel management 
processes by providing a modern, reliable, and accessible platform for both travel agents and customers.
